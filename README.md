# Competitive Programming library

## Usage

- Each directory contains specific algorithm. The algorithms are divided into categories like:
  - Strings
  - Data Structures
  - Graph Theories
  - etc...

- On each directory will be a seperate README to explain each algorithm in details

- All codes are used in a simple scenario or a simple problem to explain the algorithm's flow

However, the library is under construction, and the project is still on its first steps.
